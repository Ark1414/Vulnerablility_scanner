# Vulnerablility_scanner



 Web Application Vulnerability Scanner (FastAPI)

This project is a basic web vulnerability scanner API built with FastAPI.
It allows users to submit a target website URL and get a quick security assessment.
The scanner identifies common security risks, provides auto-generated mitigation tips, and keeps a history of recent scans.

 Features

Scan Endpoint (/scan)

Accepts a website URL (http/https).

Blocks localhost/loopback scans for safety.

Performs vulnerability checks (e.g., XSS, missing headers, exposed admin panels).

Auto-suggests mitigation tips based on findings.

Rate-limited to 5 scans/minute per IP.

History Endpoint (/history)

Returns a list of previously scanned URLs with results.

Logging

All scan requests are logged (scan_logs.log) with timestamp, level, and client IP.

Security & Safety

CORS enabled (default: *).

Rate limiting with slowapi
.

Blocks local addresses (localhost, 127.0.0.1).

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

Backend: FastAPI

Rate Limiting: SlowAPI

Data Validation: Pydantic

Logging: Python logging module

Database: In-memory list (can be extended to PostgreSQL/MySQL)

üìñ Notes

This is a demo/security learning project ‚Üí Not a full production-grade scanner.

Extend scanner.py with real vulnerability checks.

For real-world use, integrate DB (PostgreSQL/MySQL), authentication, and advanced analysis.
